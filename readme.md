# Hello world

**Name:** Mateus Cezário Barreto.

**Birth year:** 2005.

**Country:** Brazil.

**Occupations:**

 - Studying Computer Science at [UFPA](https://ufpa.br/).

**Backstory:** A socially isolated 16yo boy installed Linux in a laptopt he got from his dad. Now here he is.

**Personality:** introverted, reclusive, defensive, avoids most conversations, but still listens a lot, sometimes shy. Secretly chuunibyo. Maybe an otaku. Tries to not be frozen by the feeling of being a fraud.

**Cool:**

 - Open source software and open knoweldge.

 - Indie games (Undertale, Hollow Knight, Deltarune). ~~I'm not a gamer though.~~

 - Linux. Artix btw.

 - C.

 - Ruby.

 - GTK, with caveats.

 - Understanding thigs you use.

**Desktop tools:**

 - Artix Linux, the art of Linux.

 - Scroll, fork of Sway that makes my screen look like a big desk.

 - No bar, no wallpapaer, no decoration, because I'm both minimalistic and lazy.

 - Mousepad, this makes me minimalistic, but not so lazy.

**Not so cool:**

 - Sleeping. But it's needed.

**Hobbies:**

 - Programming. My duty is also my hobby. It's my art.

 - Listening to OST's. Choral Chambers btw. Also rest in peace River Boy.
